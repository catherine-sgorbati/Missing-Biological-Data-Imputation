# Missing-Biological-Data-Imputation
Analysis focused on handling missing gene expression data from Northern and Southern mice populations using various imputation methods. The project explores machine learning techniques for data imputation, including mean imputation, Hot-Deck, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), and missForest, with evaluations based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Differential gene expression analysis was conducted post-imputation to assess the biological significance of reconstructed datasets. This work demonstrates the critical role of accurate data imputation in preserving the integrity of biological analyses.
